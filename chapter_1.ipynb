    " **Object-oriented** languages are defined by the following:\n",
    " - encapsulation,\n",
    " - inheritance,\n",
    " - polymorphism, and\n",

    "\n",
    " People already think in objects. For example, a person is an object with attributes (like eye color, height, weight etc.) and behavior (like walking, talking, breathing etc.).\n",
    " => An **object** is an entity that contains both **data** and **behavior**.\n",
    " => The access to attributes and methods is controlled (restricted to that object = data hiding) with accessor and mutator methods (getters and setters).\n",
    " => Another object can access the data through a call to the original object's method.\n",
    " => Objects should be small and have a specific responsibility.\n",

    " **Procedural** programming (in contrast with object-oriented):\n",
    " - code is contained within functions and procedures that become black boxes (inputs in, outputs out)\n",
    " - data is placed into separate structures manipulated by these functions and procedures\n",
    " - attributes and behavior are separated\n",
    " - access to data is uncontrolled and unpredictable (multiple functions may have it)\n",
    " - testing and debugging are much more difficult"
